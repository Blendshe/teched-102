##### class 04 was about html.  

I learnt about *structuring a web page using html*.  This was done in Replt but in future it will be in VSC.

I learnt the following html tags

- Doctype html will only use once in a file
- html
- head is for the header
- body where write something for your page 
- h1 is the biggest heading and continues in ascending numbers but the size of the heading gets smaller
-
